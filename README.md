# Notion Rich Presence in Discord

This is going to create a rich presence in discord for when you're editing your pages in notion.

## Requirements
* node.js

## How to run it

Clone the repository.

## Manually
1. Run `node index.js`

## Running it with Notion on Windows
1. Edit the `start-rpc-with-notion.bat.example` file to your needs.
2. Save it as `start-rpc-with-notion.bat`.
3. Run the file `.\start-rpc-with-notion.bat` in CMD oder Powershell.

If eveything went well a CMD window will open saying: `Notion rich presence is running` and Notion will open as well.
